# FreePDF changelog

## 6.2.5 — unreleased

- Set the development version to 6.2.5 and resolve GitVersion configuration from
  the current checkout so shared-object-store worktrees use the same policy.

- Correct initial transparent strokes and fills without changing public APIs.
  Adapted from the MIT PDFsharp 7.0.0 Preview 1 implementation, with solid-color
  restoration after a gradient retained for compatibility.
- Reject truncated inline-image headers instead of looping indefinitely in the
  content reader. Adapted from the MIT preview's EOF handling.
- Write complete zlib streams, including Adler-32 checksums and empty-input
  framing. This is an independent correction against RFC 1950.
- Add synthetic regressions, expanded platform CI, and an
  [upstream feature matrix](docs/upstream-feature-tracking.md).

This is development work, not a published package or a stable-release claim.

## Initial fork

Based on the MIT PDFsharp/MigraDoc 6.2.4 source, with original history and
notices preserved. See [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md).
